<h1 align="center">2D Space Shooter - SFML version</h1>
<p align="center">This game is a 2D space shooter themed to Space Invaders, the game plays horizontally as opposed to Space Invaders' vertical gameplay. The main goal of the game is to get the highest score possible by surviving through the endless asteroids coming your way. The game was created using the SFML API and uses the FMOD audio engine for audio output. This is the SFML version of this DirectX11 project (https://github.com/AdamHoward99/2D-Space-Shooter-DirectX11)</p>
